== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are typical use cases of this plugin? =
In general it will make your donation management with Give Donations easier and faster.

**1st Example: Non-profit Organisation**  
* You have a team, including 5 Donation Managers (User role: give_manager)
* You have lots of donation form campaigns, for example 20 different active campagins (forms)
* Set your most important/current campaign as a featured top-level item in the Toolbar -- logged in Admins & Give Managers see the current income and can access all stuff related to this specific form with 1 (ONE!) mouse click!
* From the top-level "Donations" item: access all Donation related payments, donors, reports (filters etc.), settings, tools and Add-Ons directly from the Toolbar
* This helps your team get more focussed, save time (less mouse travel and searching for settings...) -- you gain more time for the things that really matter!
* Focus on more on your campaigns, reports, income/earnings, payment history - because the Toolbar presents these things front and center for you

**2nd Example: Private Donation Campaign**
* Landing Page, only 1 Form Campaign
* You are the only user of this site/install, of course you are the Administrator (has all permissions anyway)
* Set your 1 campaign as featured in the Toolbar, so you can watch your earnings each time you are logged in into your site
* Focus on your campaign because all important info, views, reports, settings etc. are only 1 (ONE!) click away
* Save time, get more focussed and more productive -- gain more time to market your campaign for personal fundraising


= Why is Toolbar Extras plugin required? =
Toolbar Extras is the "base" or "main" plugin. It provides a lot of functionality under the hood, like the settings page, and lots of helper functions. This plugin here, "Toolbar Extras for GiveWP" is just an Add-On for it, adding features on top. It extends the functionality, that means, adding more specific items to the Toolbar. In this case specifically for the Give Donations plugin.


= Why is Give Donation (GiveWP) plugin required? =
While technically the GiveWP Dashboard plugin is not "required", this Add-On here makes absolutely no sense without it.


= Why has the base plugin "Toolbar Extras" the word "Elementor" in its title? =
That is only in the plugin's readme and therefore appears on the plugin page on wordpress.org. The reason is simple: the "Elementor Add-On" is de-facto built-in in the base plugin and not an extra Add-On (like this one here for GiveWP). **But don't worry:** you won't see any Elementor stuff ever. Those integrations are **only** ever loaded at all if Elementor is installed and active.

So don't get confused :-) On your "Plugins" page in your WordPress install the base plugin is listed normally as just "Toolbar Extras" and that is also the official name and it is referenced everywhere as that only.

For more background info on this topic have look on our website:  
* *Blog post:* [Can Toolbar Extras be Used Without Elementor? (or Plugin/ Theme Xyz?)](https://toolbarextras.com/use-toolbar-extras-without-elementor/)
* *Documentation article:* [Why is Toolbar Extras required and why no standalone plugin?](https://toolbarextras.com/docs/addons-why-toolbar-extras-required/)


= Will this Plugin slow down my site? =
Absolutely not. The plugin will only do its stuff for logged-in Administrator, and optionally a few things for other Give-specific users who have certain permissions. The regular visitors will not see, or "feel" this plugin! Even a registered "Donor" basic user account won't see or "feel" this plugin at all -- it won't even load in these scenarios.


= Does the Plugin work with Multisite? =
Yes, technically it works fine in Multisite, you could even activate it Network-wide if you want. However, that will only make sense, if you also have the base plugins - Toolbar Extras, plus Give Donations - also installed and both were also activated Network-wide.

The normal use case is a single WordPress install with Toolbar Extras, plus Give Donations and this Add-On here.


= More info on Translations? =

* English - default, always included
* German (de_DE): Deutsch - immer dabei! :-)
* For custom and update-safe language files please upload them to `/wp-content/languages/toolbar-extras-givewp/` (just create this folder) - This enables you to use fully custom translations that won't be overridden on plugin updates. Also, complete custom English wording is possible with that as well, just use a language file like `toolbar-extras-givewp-en_US.mo/.po` to achieve that (for creating one see the following tools).

**Easy WordPress.org plugin translation platform with GlotPress platform:** [**Translate "Toolbar Extras for Give Donations"...**](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/toolbar-extras-givewp)

*Note:* All my plugins are internationalized/ translateable by default. This is very important for all users worldwide. So please contribute your language to the plugin to make it even more useful. For translating and validating I recommend the awesome ["Poedit Editor"](https://www.poedit.net/), which works fine on Windows, macOS and Linux.
